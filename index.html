        <h3 style="color:black;">A tool to improve production efficiency in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Allows the enterprise manager to:</h3>
        
        <p class="oe_mt32">- assess the workload of personnel and production capacities;</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">- record the personal responsibility of employees for the quality of operations performed;</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">- evaluate the time of operations, identify operations in which the most time is spent on non-core tasks;</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">- identify bottlenecks in production that cause the most downtime;</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">- assess the status of any order, analyze the risks of missing the deadline;</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">- analyze the quality of individual operations using machine learning algorithms.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color:black;">The functionality provided:</h3>
        <p class="oe_mt32">1. Enter the order number to view the operations performed as part of its execution.</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">2. View reports on operations performed demonstrating the presence or absence of violations during their execution.</p>

        <p class="oe_mt32">4. Dashboard for high-level assessment of the status of all orders in progress. 
            The dashboard allows you to assess downtime, the path of the order's progress along the production line, 
            determine the current stage of execution of the selected order, 
            make forecasts for its completion and refer to information related to the order 
            (for example, the customer's order form) or to information on the operation being performed.</p>
