        <p class="oe_mt32">When the level of safety increases, 
            it reduces the risk of industrial accidents and equipment damage, 
            which saves money on compensation for damage.</p>
        <p class="oe_mt32">When a worker approaches the machine, 
            deep learning algorithms help to recognize whether a person put on personal protective equipment. 
            If not, a notification from the application will inform the worker to put on, for example, 
            a helmet or hearing protectors when working with the machine. 
            Automated control is more reliable than hiring a person responsible for monitoring compliance with safety protocols.</p>
