            to keep everything organized and in its place. Say goodbye to the hassle of lost inventory and hello to a more productive workplace.

        <h3 style="color:black;"align="center"><b>EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE</b></h3>
       
        <p class="oe_mt32">Tool Control takes a photo of a person when taking the tool. The photo is saved in the «Reports». 
            There, any worker can see who last used the tool. 
            It also notifies by voice or text message «Don’t forget to put it back in place» when someone takes the tool.</p>
